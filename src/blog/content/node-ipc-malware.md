# TLDR
## DO NOT use or update this module if you or your production servers etc. are located in a country actively involved in the invasion of Ukraine. Author of this package opposes said invasion and put a malicious code to wipe out data and put "❤️" on where they were. You are warned about this feature. Use on your own risk.

Hey, this is a quick blog post about a topic that happened around yesterday. Brandon Nozaki Miller, or known as [RIAEvangelist](https://github.com/RIAEvangelist) on github. He wanted to spread his views about the Russian-Ukraine war, and he wanted to harm people with Russian or countries related in the Ukraine-Russian war ip's by deleting all their data and replacing it with heart emojis like this: "❤️". This is malware and a federal crime as he disguised it in a package (a popular one I might add).

This shows the darkside of opensource perfectly, one person gets some control and dependencies and uses it for bad. Basically one bad apple ruining a lot of other apples.

I have lost my trust in this dev, and wont be using his software again. I have reported him to gitub and npm.

If you would like to check if your packages are affected take a look at https://github.com/zlw9991/node-ipc-dependencies-list
